# DeepDerm: Multi-Architecture Skin Lesion Triage

**Early Detection of Malignant Skin Lesions with Deep Learning Models in Low-Resource Settings**

---

## üî¨ Overview

Skin cancer remains one of the deadliest yet most preventable forms of cancer when detected early. This project tackles the critical challenge of **automated triage for skin lesions** in non-clinical or primary care environments using low-quality, cell-phone-like dermoscopic images. Leveraging the novel **3D Total Body Photography (3D TBP)** dataset spanning thousands of patients across continents, we aim to develop and benchmark **multiple deep learning pipelines** for histologically confirmed lesion classification. This project was developed for the **ISIC 2024 - Skin Cancer Detection with 3D-TBP** competition.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository implements and compares three core modeling paradigms:

| Notebook | Model Type | Description |Performance  |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `AutoEncoder-Classifier.ipynb` | Autoencoder + Classifier | Learns latent embeddings before classification. Ideal for denoising and capturing compact lesion representations. | Poor |
| `CNN-Classifier.ipynb` | Standard CNN | Baseline convolutional classifier trained end-to-end on lesion images. | Excellent |
| `MultiModal-Classifier.ipynb` | MultiModal NN | Multimodal classifier trained end-to-end on lesion images and their corresponding tabular data. | Satisfactory |
| `DeepDerm.py`                  | Unified Inference Module | Production-ready interface that supports image-only or multimodal prediction using pre-trained Keras models and joblib pipelines. Includes device placement, input validation, and caching. | ‚Äì            |
